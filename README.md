# My First Repository

Welcome to my first repository! This is a test repo for learning and experimenting with programming.

## Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub.
- Learn how to create, modify, and organize files within a repository.
- Practice writing clean and well-documented code.
- Collaborate with other developers and learn from their feedback.

Thank you for visiting my first repository! Happy coding!
